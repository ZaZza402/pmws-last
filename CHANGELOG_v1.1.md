# Version 1.1 - Changes Summary

## 🎯 Main Fix: Scroll Position on Page Navigation

### Problem

When navigating between pages, the browser maintained the scroll position from the previous page, causing an annoying scroll effect where:

1. User clicks link to another page
2. New page loads at the same scroll position
3. Page then scrolls to intended position
4. This created a jarring user experience

### Solution

Created `ScrollToTop.jsx` component that:

- Automatically scrolls to top (position 0,0) instantly on route change
- No smooth scroll animation - instant positioning
- Handles hash navigation (#servizi, #faq, etc.) by scrolling to anchor elements
- Placed in App.jsx inside BrowserRouter for global effect
- Non-intrusive and automatic - no user action required

### Files Changed

- ✅ Created: `src/components/ScrollToTop.jsx`
- ✅ Modified: `src/App.jsx` (added ScrollToTop import and component)

---

## 🧹 Dead Code Cleanup

### Files Removed

1. ✅ `src/App.css` - Unused stylesheet (never imported)
2. ✅ `src/index.css.backup` - Backup file (shouldn't be in production)
3. ✅ `src/components/CustomLoader.jsx` - Unused loading component
4. ✅ `src/components/CustomLoader.css` - Associated unused styles
5. ✅ `src/config/serviceIcons.jsx` - Unused icon mapping
6. ✅ `src/config/services.js` - Unused config file

### Design Decision

- **ChiSiamoPage.jsx** - Kept in codebase (unrouted) for potential future use per client request
- This allows quick activation if client provides team photos and content later

---

## 🔗 Footer Navigation Fix

### Changes

- ✅ Removed broken "Chi Siamo" link from Footer.jsx
- This link was causing 404 errors since the page isn't routed

### Files Modified

- ✅ `src/components/Footer.jsx` (removed Chi Siamo nav item)

## 📝 Technical Notes

### ScrollToTop Implementation

```jsx
// src/components/ScrollToTop.jsx
// Listens to pathname and hash changes
// Scrolls to top instantly if no hash
// Scrolls to anchor element if hash exists
useEffect(() => {
  if (hash) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const element = document.querySelector(hash);
      if (element) {
        element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" });
      }
    }, 100);
  } else {
    window.scrollTo(0, 0); // Instant scroll, no smooth
  }
}, [pathname, hash]);
```

### Why Instant Scroll?

- Smooth scroll on route change feels unnatural
- Users expect immediate page transition
- Smooth scroll is reserved for in-page navigation (BackToTopButton, anchor links)
